Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm does not rely on labeled data, and it attempts to find patterns and structures in the data without being explicitly told what to look for.\n",

        "**Dimensionality Reduction:** Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most important information.
